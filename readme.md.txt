Feature Enhancement: Supports a manual mode, where user can single-step through the animation.
Press M key to switch on and off manual mode, then SPACE to advance one frame at a time. 
Manual mode can also be switched on using the Manual Mode button in the toolbar.

Edge Case Behaviour: Once a cell passes the border of the grid it is deleted. 
So a cell at 50, 75 has no neighbours below or to the right of it.
