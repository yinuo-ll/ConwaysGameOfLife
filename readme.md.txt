Conway's Game of Life

Simplified implimentation of Conway's Game of Life:
A cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

Feature Enhancement: Supports a manual mode, where user can single-step through the animation.
Press M key to switch on and off manual mode, then SPACE to advance one frame at a time. 
Manual mode can also be switched on using the Manual Mode button in the toolbar.

Edge Case Behaviour: Once a cell passes the border of the grid it is deleted. 
So a cell at 50, 75 has no neighbours below or to the right of it.
